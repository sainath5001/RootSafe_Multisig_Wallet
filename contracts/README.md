## 🎯 Overview

This multisignature wallet contract allows a group of owners to control a wallet collectively. Transactions require a minimum number of confirmations from owners before they can be executed. This provides enhanced security compared to single-signature wallets.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Owners**: Addresses that can submit, confirm, and execute transactions
- **Required Confirmations**: Minimum number of owner approvals needed to execute a transaction
- **Transactions**: Proposals to send RBTC/ETH or call contracts
- **Confirmations**: Owner approvals for pending transactions

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Multi-owner support (configurable number of owners)
- ✅ Configurable required confirmations (M-of-N scheme)
- ✅ Transaction submission, confirmation, and execution
- ✅ Confirmation revocation (before execution)
- ✅ Multisig-controlled owner & threshold management (add/remove/replace owner, change requirement)
- ✅ Safe ETH/RBTC transfers using `call()`
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Comprehensive event logging
- ✅ Gas-efficient design
- ✅ Foundry tests covering core flows and multisig-controlled owner/threshold management

## 📦 Requirements

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (latest version)
- Node.js 16+ (optional, for frontend integration)
- Rootstock testnet RBTC (for deployment)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already done):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sainath5001/RootSafe_Multisig_Wallet.git
cd RootSafe_Multisig_Wallet/contracts
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
forge install
```

This will install OpenZeppelin contracts (for ReentrancyGuard) and forge-std (for testing).

3. **Verify installation**:
```bash
forge --version
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
forge test
```

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
forge test -vvv
```

Run a specific test:

```bash
forge test --match-test test_ExecuteTransactionWithEnoughConfirmations
```

Run tests with gas reporting:

```bash
forge test --gas-report
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

- ✅ Constructor validation (empty owners, invalid confirmations, duplicates)
- ✅ Transaction submission (by owners and non-owners)
- ✅ Transaction confirmation
- ✅ Transaction execution with sufficient confirmations
- ✅ Confirmation revocation
- ✅ Revert conditions (non-owner, insufficient confirmations, already executed)
- ✅ Integration tests (full flows)
- ✅ Multiple transactions handling
- ✅ View function tests
- ✅ Owner / threshold management (`addOwner`, `removeOwner`, `replaceOwner`, `changeRequirement`) and `onlyWallet` enforcement

## 🏗️ Building

Compile the contracts:

```bash
forge build
```

This will:
- Compile all contracts
- Generate artifacts in `out/` directory
- Create ABI files in `out/MultiSigWallet.sol/MultiSigWallet.json`

**ABI Location**: `out/MultiSigWallet.sol/MultiSigWallet.json`

## 👥 Owner / Threshold Management

The contract supports changing owners and the required confirmation threshold **after deployment**, but **only via the multisig itself**.

- Admin functions are protected by `onlyWallet` (`msg.sender == address(this)`), so a single owner cannot call them directly.
- To use them, submit a transaction where:
  - `to` = the multisig contract address
  - `data` = ABI-encoded call to one of:
    - `addOwner(address)`
    - `removeOwner(address)`
    - `replaceOwner(address,address)`
    - `changeRequirement(uint256)`

Safety rules enforced:
- `changeRequirement` must satisfy \(1 \le requiredConfirmations \le owners.length\)
- `removeOwner` is blocked if it would make `requiredConfirmations > owners.length - 1` (prevents permanent lock)
- `removeOwner` also clears the removed address's confirmations on **pending** transactions (O(n) over stored transactions; can be costly for very large histories)
- `replaceOwner` clears the replaced (old) address's confirmations on **pending** transactions (O(n) over stored transactions; can be costly for very large histories)

### Data size limit

`submitTransaction` enforces `data.length <= MAX_DATA_BYTES` (24KB) to avoid huge payloads that will exceed practical gas limits.

### Pagination helper

The `transactions` array is unbounded for simplicity. For frontend pagination, use:
- `getTransactionIds(uint256 start, uint256 count)` to fetch IDs in pages.

The ABI can be used by frontend applications to interact with the deployed contract.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Get Rootstock Testnet RBTC**:
   - Use the [Rootstock Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.rsk.co/)
   - Or use a service like [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)

2. **Set up environment variables**:

Create a `.env` file in the `contracts` directory:

```bash
# Rootstock Testnet RPC URL (see examples below)
ROOTSTOCK_TESTNET_RPC=https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co

# Deployer private key (without 0x prefix)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Optional: Custom owners (comma-separated addresses)
OWNERS=0x123...,0x456...,0x789...

# Optional: Required confirmations (default: 2)
REQUIRED_CONFIRMATIONS=2
```

### Rootstock Testnet RPC URLs

**Public RPC:**
```
https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co
```

**Third-party RPC providers** (require API keys):
- **QuickNode**: `https://rsk-testnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY`
- **Infura**: `https://rootstock-testnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
- **Ankr**: `https://rpc.ankr.com/rsk_testnet`

**Chain ID**: `31` (Rootstock Testnet)
**Chain ID**: `30` (Rootstock Mainnet)

### Deploy to Rootstock Testnet

**Important**: Before deploying, you must load environment variables from your `.env` file:

```bash
# Load environment variables from .env file
set -a && source .env && set +a
```

**Basic deployment** (uses default owners from script):

```bash
# Load environment variables first
set -a && source .env && set +a

# Then deploy
forge script script/DeployMultiSig.s.sol:DeployMultiSig \
  --fork-url $ROOTSTOCK_TESTNET_RPC \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast --legacy
```

**With custom owners and confirmations**:

```bash
# Load environment variables first
set -a && source .env && set +a

# Then deploy with custom owners
OWNERS="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb,0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac136c22C929e,0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890" \
REQUIRED_CONFIRMATIONS=2 \
forge script script/DeployMultiSig.s.sol:DeployMultiSig \
  --fork-url $ROOTSTOCK_TESTNET_RPC \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast --legacy
```

**With verification** (if Rootstock explorer supports it):

```bash
# Load environment variables first
set -a && source .env && set +a

# Then deploy with verification
forge script script/DeployMultiSig.s.sol:DeployMultiSig \
  --fork-url $ROOTSTOCK_TESTNET_RPC \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast --legacy \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $ROOTSTOCK_API_KEY
```

### Deployment Output

After successful deployment, you'll see:

```
MultiSigWallet deployed successfully!
Contract address: 0x...
Number of owners: 3
Required confirmations: 2
```

**Important**: Save the contract address for frontend integration and verification.

## 👥 Understanding Ownership

### Initial owners vs. later changes

**Initial owners** are configured in the constructor at deployment time. After deployment, the owner set and confirmation threshold can be updated **only via multisig-executed transactions** that call the wallet's own admin functions (`addOwner`, `removeOwner`, `replaceOwner`, `changeRequirement`). Each of these functions is guarded by `onlyWallet` (`msg.sender == address(this)`), so a single owner cannot invoke them directly—they must be proposed, confirmed, and executed like any other multisig action.

**Note**: After deploying a new contract, update the frontend `.env.local` file with the new contract address.

### Important points

- ✅ Owners are set at deployment time, and can later be changed **only** through successful multisig transactions to the wallet
- ✅ `removeOwner` includes a deadlock guard: it reverts if removing an owner would leave `requiredConfirmations` impossible to satisfy
- ✅ `removeOwner` clears that owner's confirmations on pending transactions (see NatSpec in `MultiSigWallet.sol`)
- ⚠️ `replaceOwner` swaps an owner address and revokes the old address's confirmations on pending transactions, but it does **not** “migrate” confirmations to the new address; review pending transactions after a replacement
- ✅ Choose initial owners and thresholds carefully—malicious or careless owner votes can still change wallet policy

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Owner Management**: 
   - Owner and threshold changes are multisig-controlled (`onlyWallet`)—treat admin transactions with the same scrutiny as fund movements
   - `removeOwner` may execute an O(n) sweep over stored transactions to clear pending confirmations; very large histories increase gas costs
   - Choose owners carefully at deployment time and protect owner keys

2. **Required Confirmations**:
   - Set `requiredConfirmations` appropriately (typically 50-70% of owners)
   - Too low: Less security
   - Too high: Risk of deadlock if owners become unavailable

3. **Transaction Data**:
   - Review transaction data before confirming
   - Be cautious with contract calls that could drain funds

4. **Private Keys**:
   - Never commit private keys to version control
   - Use environment variables or hardware wallets
   - Rotate keys if compromised

5. **Reentrancy Protection**:
   - The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
   - All external calls use `call()` with proper checks

6. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive test suite included
   - Consider additional audits before mainnet deployment
